# Project Specification for Group 184

## Team Name

StockSim (TBD)

## Domain

Stock trading simulation and management.

## Software Specification

The Trading Simulation App aims to provide users with a practice environment to simulate trading activities and develop trading skills. Users will receive an initial balance depending on the selected difficulty level and perform buy/sell operations using various stock tickers. A key feature is monitoring balances and enforcing a "game over" scenario if the balance drops below zero.

## User Stories

1. As a new user,
I want to register an account and receive an initial virtual balance,
so that I can start practicing trades in the simulation environment.

2. As a user participating in the trading simulation,
I want to buy or sell stocks through the trading window,
so that I can practice trading strategies and see how market fluctuations impact my portfolio.

3. As a user with active trades,
I want to monitor my portfolio in real time,
so that I can make informed decisions about when to buy or sell stocks.
